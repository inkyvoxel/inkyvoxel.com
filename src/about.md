Hello! I’m Mark Brady. I love writing code and creating goofy art. I enjoy figuring out how things work (and sometimes, why they don’t).

I've been building web applications for over 15 years, mostly with .NET in large organisations, but I like to experiment with all sorts of languages and frameworks. I’m comfortable on both the backend and frontend, and I like seeing how all the pieces fit together.

I have lots of experience using cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, and I’ve been building infrastructure as code with tools like Terraform for nearly a decade. If something can be automated, I’ll probably write a script for it.

Linux is my daily driver, and I love the challenge of self-hosting apps on virtual private servers (and even [old laptops](/using-an-old-laptop-as-a-home-server)).

Security is another one of my interests. I enjoy finding, exploiting, and fixing vulnerabilities in web applications.

I've also made some games, which you can play on [itch.io](https://inkyvoxel.itch.io/).

If you want to chat, you'll find me on [X](https://x.com/inkyvoxel), or you can check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inkyvoxel).

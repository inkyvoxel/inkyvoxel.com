Hello! I'm Mark Brady, a software engineer with over 15 years of experience building web applications. I love writing code and creating goofy art.

Most of my professional life has been spent working with C# and .NET in large organisations, but I'm always keen to experiment with different programming languages, libraries and frameworks. I'm comfortable on both the backend and frontend of web applications, and I enjoy seeing how all the pieces fit together to create something functional and fun.

I've got lots of experience with cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, and I've been building infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform for nearly a decade. If there's a way to automate something, I'll usually write a script for it.

Security is another passion of mine. I enjoy finding, exploiting, and fixing vulnerabilities in web applications.

Linux is my daily driver, and I am comfortable using it to solve all kinds of problems. I relish the challenge of self-hosting applications on virtual private servers, and even [old laptops](/using-an-old-laptop-as-a-home-server).

I've made some games that you can play on [itch.io](https://inkyvoxel.itch.io/), and I would love to build more in the future! Gaming is what got me into software engineering in the first place.

If you fancy a chat, you'll find me on [X](https://x.com/inkyvoxel), or you can check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inkyvoxel).

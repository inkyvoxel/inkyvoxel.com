Hello! I am Mark Brady. I love writing code and creating goofy art.

I am a software engineer who has been in the industry for over 15 years. I love building full-stack web applications in highly collaborative teams.

As well as writing code, I am also interested in detecting, exploiting, and fixing vulnerabilities in web applications.

You can get in touch with me on [X](https://x.com/inkyvoxel), and you can view some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/inkyvoxel).

Content and opinions on this website are my own.

Over December 2025, I picked up [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/inkyvoxel) again after a couple of years' break. Completing their 'Advent of Cyber 2025' challenges really got me back into the groove of cybersecurity training. It was a fun way to end the year and has motivated me to continue learning in 2026.

This year, I aim to write more notes on cybersecurity topics, as well as software engineering and other areas of interest. I'm particularly keen to dive deeper into web application security.

Here's to a productive and secure 2026!

Hello! I am Mark Brady. I love writing code and creating goofy art.

I am a software engineer who has been in the industry for over 10 years. I love building full-stack web applications in highly collaborative teams.

More recently, I have been learning about cyber security. I especially enjoy learning how to detect, exploit and fix vulnerabilities in web applications.

Content and opinions on this website are my own.

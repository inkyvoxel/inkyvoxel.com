Blog for Mark Brady (@inkyvoxel), built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). I share my thoughts as a software engineer, team lead, and cybersecurity enthusiast.

Run locally with:

1. `mise install` (to install the required Node.js version using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev))
2. `npm install`
3. `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`

Format, lint, and organise imports:

```
npx @biomejs/biome check --write .
```
